At the Polo Club of Data Science, led by <b>Polo Chau</b>, we innovate scalable, interactive, and interpretable tools that amplify human's ability to understand and interact with billion-scale data and machine learning models. Our current research thrusts human-centered AI (interpretable, fair, safe AI; adversarial ML); large graph visualization and mining; cybersecurity; and social good (health, energy).
