title: Jigsaw to save vastopolis.
venue: IEEE VAST
year: 2011
---
This article describes our analytic process and experience of using the Jigsaw system in working on the VAST 2011 Mini Challenge 3. We describe how we extracted and worked with entities from the documents, and how Jigsaw's computational analysis capabilities and visualizations scaffolded the investigation. Based on our experiences, we discuss desirable features that would enhance the analytic power of Jigsaw.
