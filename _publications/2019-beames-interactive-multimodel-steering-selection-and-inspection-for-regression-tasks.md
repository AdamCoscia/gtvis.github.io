Interactive model steering helps people incrementally build machine learning models that are tailored to their domain and task. Existing visual analytic tools allow people to steer a single model (e.g., assignment attribute weights used by a dimension reduction model). However, the choice of model is critical in such situations. What if the model chosen is suboptimal for the task, dataset, or question being asked? What if instead of parameterizing and steering this model, a different model provides a better fit? This paper presents a technique to allow users to inspect and steer multiple machine learning models. The technique steers and samples models from a broader set of learning algorithms and model types. We incorporate this technique into a visual analytic prototype, BEAMES, that allows users to perform regression tasks via multimodel steering. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of BEAMES via a use case, and discusses broader implications for multimodel steering.
