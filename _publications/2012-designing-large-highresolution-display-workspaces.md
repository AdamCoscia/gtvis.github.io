title: Designing large high-resolution display workspaces.
venue: AVI
year: 2012
---
Large, high-resolution displays have enormous potential to aid in scenarios beyond their current usage. Their current usages are primarily limited to presentations, visualization demonstrations, or conducting experiments. In this paper, we present a new usage for such systems: an everyday workspace. We discuss how seemingly small large-display design decisions can have significant impacts on users' perceptions of these workspaces, and thus the usage of the space. We describe the effects that various physical configurations have on the overall usability and perception of the display. We present conclusions on how to broaden the usage scenarios of large, high-resolution displays to enable frequent and effective usage as everyday workspaces while still allowing transformation to collaborative or presentation spaces.
