title: 'GeneTracer: Gene sequence analysis of disease mutations VAST 2010 mini challenge
  3 award: Excellent process explanation.'
venue: IEEE VAST
year: 2010

Our visual analytics tool GeneTracer, developed for the VAST 2010 genetic sequence mini challenge, visualizes gene sequences of current outbreaks and native sequences along with disease characteristics. We successfully used GeneTracer in combination with data mining techniques to solve the challenge.
