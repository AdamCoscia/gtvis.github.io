title: Reaching Broader Audiences With Data Visualization.
venue: IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications

The visualization research community can and should reach broader audiences beyond data-savvy groups of people, because these audiences could also greatly benefit from visual access to data. In this article, we discuss four research topics-personal data visualization, data visualization on mobile devices, inclusive data visualization, and multimodal interaction for data visualization-that, individually and collaboratively, would help us reach broader audiences with data visualization, making data more accessible.
