title: 'VisIRR: Visual analytics for information retrieval and recommendation with
  large-scale document data.'
venue: IEEE VAST
year: 2014
---
We present VisIRR, an interactive visual information retrieval and recommendation system for large-scale document data. Starting with a query, VisIRR visualizes the retrieved documents in a scatter plot along with their topic summary. Next, based on interactive personalized preference feedback on the documents, VisIRR collects and visualizes potentially relevant documents out of the entire corpus so that an integrated analysis of both retrieved and recommended documents can be performed seamlessly.
