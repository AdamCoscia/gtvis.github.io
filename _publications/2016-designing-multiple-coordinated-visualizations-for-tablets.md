title: Designing Multiple Coordinated Visualizations for Tablets.

The use of multiple coordinated views (MCV) in data visualization provides analytic power because it allows a person to explore data under a variety of different perspectives. Since this design pattern utilizes multiple visualizations and requires coordinated interactions across the views, a clever use of screen space is vital and many synchronized interface operations must be provided. Bringing this design pattern to tablet computers is challenging due to their small display size and the absence of keyboard and mouse input. In this article, we explain important design considerations for MCV visualization on tablets and describe a prototype MCV visualization system we have built for the iPad. The design is based on the principles of maximizing screen space for data presentation, promoting consistent interactions across visualizations, and minimizing occlusion from a person's hands.
