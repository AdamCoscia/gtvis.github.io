Visualizations often use spatial representations to aid understanding, but it is unclear what properties of a spatial information presentation are most important to effectively support cognitive processing. This research explores how spatial layout and view control impact learning and investigates the role of persistent visibility when working with large displays. We performed a controlled experiment with a learning activity involving memory and comprehension of a visually represented story. We compared performance between a slideshow-type presentation on a single monitor and a spatially distributed presentation among multiple monitors. We also varied the method of view control (automatic vs. interactive). Additionally, to separate effects due to location or persistent visibility with a spatially distributed layout, we controlled whether all story images could always be seen or if only one image could be viewed at a time. With the distributed layouts, participants maintained better memory of the associated locations where information was presented. However, learning scores were significantly better for the slideshow presentation than for the distributed layout when only one image could be viewed at a time.
