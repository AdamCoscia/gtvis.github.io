Visual analytics (VA)-the fusion of analytical reasoning and computational data analysis with rich, interactive visual representations-promises to provide many relevant techniques for business-ecosystem-intelligence systems. However, the effectiveness of such systems requires the careful curation of complex, heterogeneous, and distributed data; an in-depth understanding of the business ecosystem context and end-user domain; and the corresponding design of relevant visualizations and metrics.
