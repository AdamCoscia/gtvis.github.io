Researchers and users of Information Visualization are convinced that it has value. This value can easily be communicated to others in a face-to-face setting, such that this value is experienced in practice. To convince broader audiences, and also, to understand the intrinsic qualities of visualization is more difficult, however. In this paper we consider information visualization from different points of view, and gather arguments to explain the value of our field.
