title: Multimodal interaction for data visualization.
venue: AVI
year: 2018

Multimodal interaction offers many potential benefits for data visualization. It can help people stay in the flow of their visual analysis and presentation, with the strengths of one interaction modality offsetting the weaknesses of others. Furthermore, multimodal interaction offers strong promise for leveraging data visualization on diverse display hardware including mobile, AR/VR, and large displays. However, prior research on visualization and interaction techniques has mostly explored a single input modality such as mouse, touch, pen, or more recently, natural language. The unique challenges and opportunities of synergistic multimodal interaction for data visualization have yet to be investigated. This workshop will bring together researchers with expertise in visualization, interaction design, and natural user interfaces. We aim to build a community of researchers focusing on multimodal interaction for data visualization, explore opportunities and challenges in our research, and establish an agenda for multimodal interaction research specifically for data visualization.
