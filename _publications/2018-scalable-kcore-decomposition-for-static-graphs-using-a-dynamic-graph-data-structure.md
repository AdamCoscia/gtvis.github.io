title: Scalable K-Core Decomposition for Static Graphs Using a Dynamic Graph Data Structure.
venue: Big Data

We are developing an interactive graph exploration system called Graph Playground for making sense of large graphs. Graph Playground offers a fast and scalable edge decomposition algorithm, based on iterative vertex-edge peeling, to decompose million-edge graphs in seconds. Graph Playground introduces a novel graph exploration approach and a 3D representation framework that simultaneously reveals (1) peculiar subgraph structure discovered through the decompositionâ€™s layers, (e.g., quasi-cliques), and (2) possible vertex roles in linking such subgraph patterns across layers.
