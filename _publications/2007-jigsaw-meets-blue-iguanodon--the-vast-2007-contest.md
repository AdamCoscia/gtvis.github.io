title: Jigsaw meets Blue Iguanodon - The VAST 2007 Contest.
venue: IEEE VAST
year: 2007
---
This article describes our use of the Jigsaw system in working on the VAST 2007 contest. Jigsaw provides multiple views of a document collection and the individual entities within those documents, with a particular focus on exposing connections between entities. We describe how we refined the identified entities in order to better facilitate Jigsaw's use and how the different views helped us to uncover key parts of the underlying plot.
