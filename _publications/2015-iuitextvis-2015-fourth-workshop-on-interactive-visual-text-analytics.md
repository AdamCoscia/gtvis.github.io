title: 'IUI-TextVis 2015: Fourth Workshop on Interactive Visual Text Analytics.'
venue: ACM IUI
year: 2015
---
Analyzing text documents has been a key research topic in many areas. Countless approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, and they are largely categorized into fully automated approaches (via statistical techniques) or human-involved exploratory ones (via interactive visualization). The primary purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from both sides and provide them with opportunities to discuss ways to harmonize the power of these two complementary approaches. The combination will allow us to push the boundary of text analytics. The detailed workshop schedule, proceedings, and agenda will be available at http://www.textvis.org.
