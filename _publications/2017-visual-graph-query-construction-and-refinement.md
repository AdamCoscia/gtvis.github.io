title: Visual Graph Query Construction and Refinement.
venue: SIGMOD Conference
year: 2017
---
Locating and extracting subgraphs from large network datasets is a challenge in many domains, one that often requires learning new querying languages. We will present the first demonstration of VISAGE, an interactive visual graph querying approach that empowers analysts to construct expressive queries, without writing complex code (see our video: https://youtu.be/l2L7Y5mCh1s). VISAGE guides the construction of graph queries using a data-driven approach, enabling analysts to specify queries with varying levels of specificity, by sampling matches to a query during the analyst's interaction. We will demonstrate and invite the audience to try VISAGE on a popular film-actor-director graph from Rotten Tomatoes.
