Teaching InfoVis is a challenge because it is a new and growing field. This paper describes the results of a teaching survey based on the information given by the attendees of Dagstuhl Seminar 07221. It covers several aspects of offered InfoVis courses that range from different kinds of study materials to practical exercises. We have reproduced the discussion during the seminar and added our own experiences. We hope that this paper can serve as an interesting and helpful source for current and future InfoVis teachers.
