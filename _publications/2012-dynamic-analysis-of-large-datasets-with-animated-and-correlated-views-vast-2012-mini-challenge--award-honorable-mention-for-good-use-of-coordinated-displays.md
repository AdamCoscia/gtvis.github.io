title: 'Dynamic analysis of large datasets with animated and correlated views: VAST
  2012 Mini Challenge # award: Honorable mention for good use of coordinated displays.'
venue: IEEE VAST
year: 2012

In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated visual analytics tool, AVIST. By adopting the in-situ visualization architecture on the GPUs, AVIST supports real-time data analysis and visualization of massive scale datasets, such as VAST 2012 Challenge dataset. The design objective of the tool is to identify temporal patterns from large and complex data. To achieve this goal, we introduce three unique features: automatic animation, disjunctive data filters, and time-synced visualization of multiple datasets.
