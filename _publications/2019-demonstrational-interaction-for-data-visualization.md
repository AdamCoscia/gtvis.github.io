title: Demonstrational Interaction for Data Visualization.
venue: IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications
year: 2019

Recently, there has been an increasing trend to extend the demonstrational interaction paradigm to visualization tools. As more analytic operations can be performed by demonstration, new user tasks can be supported. In this paper, we discuss the properties of tasks where the by-demonstration paradigm can be effective and describe the main components needed to implement the demonstrational paradigm in visualization tools.
