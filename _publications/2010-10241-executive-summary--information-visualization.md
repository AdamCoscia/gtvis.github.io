Information Visualization (InfoVis) focuses on the use of visualization techniques to help people understand and analyze data. While related fields such as Scientific Visualization involve the presentation of data that has some physical or geometric correspondence, Information Visualization centers on abstract information without such correspondences. The aim of this seminar was to bring together theoreticians and practitioners from the field with a special focus on the intersection of InfoVis and Human-Computer Interaction. To support discussions that are related to the visualization of real world data, researchers from selected application areas also attended and contributed. During the seminar, working groups on eight different topics were formed and enabled a critical reflection on ongoing research efforts, the state of the field, and key research challenges today.
