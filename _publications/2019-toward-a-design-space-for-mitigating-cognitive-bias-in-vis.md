title: Toward a Design Space for Mitigating Cognitive Bias in Vis.
venue: IEEE VIS (Short Papers)
year: 2019

The use of cognitive heuristics often leads to fast and effective decisions. However, they can also systematically and predictably lead to errors known as cognitive biases. Strategies for minimizing or mitigating these biases, however, remain largely non-technological (e.g., training courses). The growing use of visual analytic (VA) tools for analysis and decision making enables a new class of bias mitigation strategies. In this work, we explore the ways in which the design of visualizations (vis) may be used to mitigate cognitive biases. We derive a design space comprised of 8 dimensions that can be manipulated to impact a user's cognitive and analytic processes and describe them through an example hiring scenario. This design space can be used to guide and inform future vis systems that may integrate cognitive processes more closely.
